# StreamShare - Advanced IPTV Access Management Platform

## Overview

StreamShare is a comprehensive IPTV management solution that allows secure sharing of a single IPTV provider account with multiple users. Built upon the foundations of [jtdevops/iptv-proxy](https://github.com/jtdevops/iptv-proxy) and [pierre-emmanuelJ/iptv-proxy](https://github.com/pierre-emmanuelJ/iptv-proxy), this project has evolved far beyond a simple proxy to become a full-featured platform with authentication, stream multiplexing, and media management capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Stream Multiplexing** - Share a single IPTV subscription with multiple users simultaneously
- **Authentication Options**
  - LDAP integration for enterprise user management
  - Basic authentication for simpler setups
- **Content Management**
  - M3U/M3U8 playlist proxying with credential protection
  - Xtream Codes API compatibility (live, VOD, series, EPG)
  - Robust handling of Unicode characters and malformed responses
- **VOD Caching and Local Playback**
  - Cache movies or episodes locally (1–14 days) with progress tracking
  - Automatically stream from cached content for downloads and VOD/series endpoints when available
- **Local Catchup Buffering**
  - Every active live stream is written to disk as it plays, enabling pause and rewind on any channel — even those without provider-side catchup support
  - TiviMate (and other Xtream-compatible players) automatically show the rewind UI on all channels
  - Channels that already have native catchup continue to use the provider's own timeshift endpoint unchanged
  - Configurable buffer duration (default 4 hours) and pause grace period for seamless pause/resume
- **On-Screen Error Slates**
  - When the provider fails, viewers see the reason rendered on screen instead of a frozen picture or a silently dropped connection
  - Shows the error code, its official meaning, and a message you control per code
  - Keeps retrying the provider behind the slate and resumes live video if it comes back
- **User Experience**
  - Enhanced VOD search, including series episodes (queries like "the office s02e04")
  - Discord bot with prettier embed-based responses, dropdown selection, and pagination
  - Temporary streaming links for content sharing
  - Session management with configurable timeouts
- **Administration**
  - Status API for monitoring active streams and users
  - Stream timeout enforcement and user management
  - PostgreSQL persistence for settings and state
- **Deployment**
  - Docker-ready with comprehensive environment variables
  - Reverse proxy compatibility with HTTPS support

### Upcoming Features

  - Streaming quality metrics and analytics
- **Frontend for download link generation**
  - User-friendly interface for creating and managing download links

## How It Works

### Stream Multiplexing Technology

StreamShare's cool feature is its ability to efficiently multiplex streams. When multiple users request the same content:

1. The first user request establishes a single connection to the IPTV provider
2. StreamShare buffers the incoming stream data
3. All subsequent user requests for the same content receive data from this buffer
4. The provider sees only one connection, while multiple users can watch simultaneously
5. When all users disconnect, the upstream connection is gracefully closed

This technology significantly reduces load on the IPTV provider, prevents account limiting/banning for multiple connections, and improves stream start times for subsequent viewers.

### M3U/M3U8 Proxy

StreamShare transforms original IPTV playlist URLs into secure endpoints on your server:

**Original M3U Example:**
```m3u
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-ID="examplechanel1.com" tvg-name="chanel1" tvg-logo="http://ch.xyz/logo1.png" group-title="USA HD",CHANEL1-HD
http://iptvexample.net:1234/12/test/1
```

**Proxied Output:**
```m3u
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-ID="examplechanel1.com" tvg-name="chanel1" tvg-logo="http://ch.xyz/logo1.png" group-title="USA HD",CHANEL1-HD
http://yourstreamshare.com:8080/12/test/1?username=test&password=passwordtest
```

**Quick Start Example:**
```bash
streamshare --m3u-url http://provider.com/get.php?username=user&password=pass&type=m3u_plus&output=m3u8 \
       --port 8080 \
       --hostname streamshare.example.com \
       --auth-user test \
       --auth-password passwordtest
```
Access your playlist at:  
`http://streamshare.example.com:8080/iptv.m3u?username=test&password=passwordtest`

### Xtream Codes API Compatibility

StreamShare fully supports the Xtream Codes API with enhanced error handling and response sanitization:

```bash
streamshare --m3u-url http://provider.com:1234/get.php?username=user&password=pass&type=m3u_plus&output=m3u8 \
       --port 8080 \
       --hostname streamshare.example.com \
       --xtream-user provider_username \
       --xtream-password provider_password \
       --xtream-base-url http://provider.com:1234 \
       --auth-user your_username \
       --auth-password your_password
```

**Access with Your Credentials:**
```
user: your_username
password: your_password
base-url: http://streamshare.example.com:8080
```

## Discord Bot Integration

StreamShare includes a powerful Discord bot for content discovery and streaming. When enabled with the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable, users can:

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/link <ldap_username>` | Link your Discord account with your LDAP username |
| `/vod <query>` | Search movies and series; supports queries like `show s02e04` |
| `/cache <title> <days>` | Cache a movie or episode on the server for 1–14 days |
| `/cached` | List cached items and expiration times |
| `/status` | Show server status (admin only) |
| `/history [username] [period]` | Watch history timeline for live and VOD (admin only). Omit `username` for a feed across all clients; `period` selects the window (24h, 7d, 30d, 90d, all time) |
| `/disconnect <ldap_username>` | Disconnect a user from the stream |
| `/timeout <ldap_username> <minutes>` | Temporarily block a user for N minutes |

Tips:
- Link your account first with `/link <ldap_user>`.
- Use specific queries to find episodes, e.g. `game of thrones s02e04` or `S1E1`.

---

## API Documentation (Internal)

StreamShare exposes an internal API (used by the Discord bot and admin tools) under `/api/internal`.

| `/api/internal/ip-aliases/delete/:ip` | POST | Remove the alias for an IP address | X-API-Key |

There is also an unauthenticated **`GET /healthz`** at the server root (not under `/api/internal`) that reports container **readiness** — `200` once the service has finished starting and is listening, `503`/refused before then. It drives the Docker `HEALTHCHECK`; see [Container Health & Startup Ordering](#container-health--startup-ordering). (This is separate from provider/VPN health, which is on `/api/internal/health` above.)

### Building a dashboard

Everything above is machine-readable JSON (`{success, data, error}`) and is enough to build an external dashboard, including one that combines several stream-share instances:

- **Active streams**: `/api/internal/streams` or `/api/internal/status` for live sessions and viewers. Each stream item includes a display-resolved `stream_title` (never blank — falls back through the channel/VOD name index to the raw stream ID) and, for live channels, an optional `tech` object with audio/video technical info (see below).
- **Watch history**: `/api/internal/history` (global) or `/api/internal/history/:username`, both paginated with `limit`/`offset` and filterable with `hours`.
- **VOD search**: `/api/internal/vod/search` — the same live provider search used by the `/vod` Discord command.
- **Overview stats**: `/api/internal/stats` for counts and leaderboards to show on a summary page.
- **Multi-instance**: this API has no built-in concept of "instance" or "tenant" — each deployment is independent, with its own database and API key. Call `/api/internal/instance` on each one to fetch a stable display name (set via `INSTANCE_NAME`, see below) and combine results client-side by polling each instance's base URL with its own API key.

#### Viewer identity and IP aliases

Every place a viewer shows up — `streams`/`status`'s `viewers` list, `users`, and `history`'s `username` field — is keyed by whatever `resolveRequestUsername` resolved for that request. With LDAP enabled that's the LDAP username; with LDAP disabled, the native Xtream streaming routes carry no per-request credentials, so **the client's raw IP address becomes the de-facto viewer identity** instead.

Rather than showing bare IPs in a dashboard, assign each one a friendly name:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ip_address": "192.168.1.42", "alias": "Living Room TV"}' \
  https://streamshare.example.com/api/internal/ip-aliases
```

Every endpoint that surfaces a viewer identity then includes a resolved `display_name` alongside the raw one — e.g. `streams`/`status` return `viewers: [{"id": "192.168.1.42", "display_name": "Living Room TV"}]` instead of a bare string list, `users` adds a top-level `display_name`, and `history`'s per-entry `username` is joined by a `display_name`. The raw `id`/`username` (IP or LDAP username) is always still there too — that's the real identity used for lookups (e.g. `GET /users/:username`, `GET /history/:username`); the alias is display-only. One alias per IP: posting again for the same `ip_address` replaces the existing alias rather than adding a second one. This also flows into the Discord `/status` and `/history` text output, so aliases show up there too.

#### Technical stream info (`tech`)

When `STREAM_TECH_PROBE_ENABLED=true`, active stream items (from `/api/internal/streams`, `/streams/:streamid`, `/status`, and the Discord `/status` command's text output) include a `tech` object with best-effort audio/video/subtitle characteristics detected by `ffprobe`:

```json
"tech": {
  "container_format": "mpegts",
  "video_codec": "h264", "width": 1920, "height": 1080, "frame_rate": 25, "video_bitrate_kbps": 4500,
  "audio_tracks": [
    {"index": 1, "codec": "aac", "channels": 2, "sample_rate_hz": 48000, "language": "eng", "bitrate_kbps": 128},
    {"index": 2, "codec": "aac", "channels": 2, "sample_rate_hz": 48000, "language": "spa", "bitrate_kbps": 128}
  ],
  "subtitle_tracks": [
    {"index": 3, "codec": "dvb_subtitle", "language": "eng"}
  ],
  "probed_at": "2026-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Notes:
- **No extra provider connection either way**:
  - **Live channels** are probed from a small sample of bytes already flowing through that channel's existing shared upstream connection (the same one serving its viewers) — never an additional connection to your provider, so it's safe even on strict concurrent-connection limits. A channel is only probed once it has at least one real viewer (there's nothing to sample otherwise).
  - **Cached VOD/series** (once fully downloaded — see [VOD Caching](#vod-caching)) are probed directly off the local file, no network involved at all. Because the whole file is available (unlike a short live sample), this reliably lists every audio and subtitle track the file contains, not just whichever one happened to be in the sample; `duration_sec` is also included. VOD/series that aren't cached (or aren't fully downloaded yet) have no `tech`.
- Requires `ffprobe` in the runtime image (bundled in the official Docker image; if you build your own, install `ffmpeg`).
- Off by default. Results are cached for a few minutes per stream and refreshed lazily on the next request after the cache goes stale — list endpoints never block waiting on a probe, but `/streams/:streamid` (a single-item lookup) will wait briefly for a fresh result if nothing is cached yet.

### Authentication

API requests require an API key provided in the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key" https://streamshare.example.com/api/internal/status
```

The API key is automatically generated on first run and stored in the database.

To override, set `INTERNAL_API_KEY` in the environment so the bot and integrations can authenticate reliably.

Set `INSTANCE_NAME` to give this deployment a stable display name (defaults to the machine hostname), returned by `/api/internal/instance` — useful when a dashboard combines data from multiple stream-share instances.

Set `STREAM_TECH_PROBE_ENABLED=true` to enable the `tech` (audio/video technical info) field on active live streams — see [Technical stream info](#technical-stream-info-tech) above.

## Session Management

StreamShare includes sophisticated session management with configurable timeouts:

- **User Sessions** - Track user logins and activity
- **Stream Sessions** - Monitor and manage active streams
- **Temporary Links** - Create expiring download URLs

Configure with environment variables:
```
SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=120  # User session timeout (default: 60)
STREAM_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=240   # Stream session timeout (default: 120)
TEMP_LINK_HOURS=24           # Temporary link validity (default: 24)
```

### LDAP Authentication Caching

Media players re-send credentials on every request — including every HTTP Range request while a movie plays — so a single playback can mean hundreds of LDAP bind and search round trips. Successful authentications are cached briefly to avoid that:

```
LDAP_AUTH_CACHE_MINUTES=5    # Trust a successful login for this long (default: 5; 0 = re-check every request)
```

Behavior:
- **Only successes are cached.** A failed login always re-checks the directory, so a corrected password works immediately and an LDAP outage is never remembered as a denial.
- Credentials are never stored. The cache key is a keyed hash, salted per process.
- **The trade-off is revocation latency**: a disabled account or changed password keeps working until its entry expires. Set `LDAP_AUTH_CACHE_MINUTES=0` if revocation must take effect at once.

### Direct Stream URLs

StreamShare supports direct stream URLs with proxy authentication in the path:

```
https://streamshare.example.com/username/password/12345
https://streamshare.example.com/live/username/password/12345
https://streamshare.example.com/movie/username/password/12345
https://streamshare.example.com/series/username/password/12345
```

These URLs are useful for direct integration with media players and other systems.

When the target movie or series episode is cached and ready, these endpoints serve the local file (with HTTP range support) instead of proxying upstream.

### Temporary Links

Generate temporary download links that expire after a configurable period:

```
https://streamshare.example.com/download/a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

Behavior:
- If the requested VOD is cached and ready, the file is served directly from local storage.
- Otherwise, the request is proxied from the provider.

Temporary links are perfect for sharing VOD content with users who don't have StreamShare accounts. Control lifetime with `TEMP_LINK_HOURS`.

### VOD Caching

Cache movies or episodes to disk for faster start times and to reduce upstream usage:

- Start a cache from Discord with `/cache <title> <days>` (1–14 days).
- Track progress and list items with `/cached`.
- Cached items automatically serve for both downloads and VOD/series streaming endpoints when available.

Configuration:
- `CACHE_FOLDER` — Absolute path to the root cache directory. stream-share creates purpose-specific subfolders underneath it: `<CACHE_FOLDER>/vod` for cached VOD media and `<CACHE_FOLDER>/catchup` for live catchup buffers. Defaults to `$TMPDIR/stream-share` when unset.
- `INTERNAL_API_KEY` — API key used by the internal API (Discord bot and tools).

---

## Local Catchup Buffering

StreamShare can buffer every active live stream to disk as it plays, giving all channels a rewind/catchup capability regardless of whether your IPTV provider supports it.

### How It Works

1. When a viewer starts watching a live channel, a `.ts` file is opened in the configured buffer directory and the stream is written to it in real time.
2. A time-to-offset index is maintained in memory so any point in the stream can be found quickly.
3. `get_live_streams` responses are patched to set `tv_archive=1` on all channels, so TiviMate (and other Xtream-compatible players) show the rewind UI everywhere.
4. When a timeshift request arrives, stream-share checks whether the channel has **native** provider catchup:
   - **Yes** → the request is proxied to the provider's own timeshift endpoint (zero change from before).
   - **No** → the request is served from the local disk buffer at the requested timestamp offset.
5. When all viewers leave, the buffer keeps recording for a configurable grace period (`CATCHUP_PAUSE_GRACE_MINUTES`) so that a TiviMate "pause" (which looks like a disconnect at the protocol level) can resume seamlessly via timeshift. A genuine channel switch is detected separately and stops recording immediately.

### Disk Usage

At 10 Mbps a 4-hour buffer is approximately **18 GB per active channel**. Only channels that are currently being watched are buffered — idle channels use no space. Files are deleted when a stream stops and cleaned up on startup.

### Configuration

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CATCHUP_ENABLED` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable |
| `CATCHUP_DURATION_HOURS` | `4` | Hours of catchup to buffer and advertise to clients |
| `CATCHUP_PAUSE_GRACE_MINUTES` | `5` | Minutes to keep recording after the last viewer leaves (for pause/resume); channel switches bypass this |
| `TZ` | — | **Required.** Must match the timezone of your IPTV clients — TiviMate sends local time in timeshift URLs (e.g. `TZ=Europe/Amsterdam`) |

---

## On-Screen Error Slates

When a provider refuses or fails to answer, players give the viewer nothing useful — the picture freezes, or the connection closes with no explanation. Instead of dropping the stream, StreamShare can play a short generated clip that says what went wrong, and keep retrying the provider behind it.

The slate shows three things: the error code, its official meaning, and a message you control.

```
              Error 456 - Connection Limit
          All provider connections are in use.
                      NL Sport 1
```

### How It Works

1. A viewer opens a live channel and the provider fails — a 403, a 404, a connection limit, a timeout, or an unreachable host.
2. The failure is classified and turned into a slate rendered with ffmpeg, then cached on disk so the same error is never rendered twice.
3. Every viewer of that channel sees the slate while the provider is retried in the background, with backoff.
4. If the provider comes back, live video resumes. If it does not come back within the retry budget, the stream stops as it did before.

Behavior:
- Applies to **live and timeshift** streams only. Movies and series are served over HTTP byte ranges, where injecting a clip would corrupt the response, so they are untouched.
- Requires `ffmpeg` and the DejaVu font, both present in the Docker image. If either is missing the feature quietly disables itself and streams drop exactly as before — so upgrading is safe and downgrading loses nothing.
- Resuming live video after a slate is a stream discontinuity. Most players re-sync on it, but behavior varies by player.

### Configuration

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ERROR_SLATE_ENABLED` | `true` | Set to `false` to drop failed streams instead of showing a slate |
| `ERROR_SLATE_RETRY_MAX_MINUTES` | `10` | How long to keep showing the slate and retrying the provider before giving up |
| `ERROR_SLATE_MESSAGES_FILE` | — | Optional path to a JSON file customising the message shown per error code |

### Customising the messages

The built-in messages are deliberately generic. To write your own — pointing users at your support channel, say — create a JSON file and point `ERROR_SLATE_MESSAGES_FILE` at it:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
environment:
  ERROR_SLATE_MESSAGES_FILE: "/root/error-messages.json"
volumes:
  - ss_config:/root     # error-messages.json lives here
```

The file is a single object mapping an error key to the text for that error:

```json
{
  "403": { "message": "Your subscription does not include this channel." },
  "404": { "message": "This channel was removed by the provider." },
  "456": { "meaning": "Connection limit", "message": "All slots are in use. Ask in #support." },
  "UNREACHABLE": { "message": "The provider is down. We are on it." }
}
```

**The key** is either an HTTP status code as a string (`"403"`), or one of these for failures that never produced a response:

| Key | When it is used |
|---|---|
| `UNREACHABLE` | The provider could not be contacted at all |
| `TIMEOUT` | The provider accepted the connection but did not respond in time |
| `DNS` | The provider's hostname could not be resolved |
| `TLS` | The provider's certificate could not be verified |

**The fields** are both optional, and each falls back independently — so overriding one does not blank the other:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `message` | Your custom text, shown under the headline. Falls back to the built-in message for that code, then to a generic one. |
| `meaning` | The official meaning shown next to the code. Usually omit it: standard HTTP codes already resolve to their proper text (`403` → `Forbidden`). Worth setting only for non-standard provider codes like `456` or `461`, which have no official meaning. |

Notes:
- Any key not in the file keeps its built-in wording, so the file only needs the codes you actually want to change.
- Unknown keys are accepted, so you can add a provider-specific code (`"499"`) without a code change.
- The file is read once at startup — restart the container after editing it.
- A missing or malformed file logs a warning and falls back to the built-in messages. Bad JSON never stops streams from being served.
- Text is sanitised before rendering, so characters that are meaningful to ffmpeg (`:`, quotes, `\`, `%`) are dropped from the picture. Keep messages plain.
- Long messages wrap to two lines and are then truncated — aim for something short enough to read at a glance from the sofa.

---

## Container Health & Startup Ordering

The image defines a Docker `HEALTHCHECK` that reports **readiness**: the container becomes `healthy` once stream-share has finished starting up and is listening, and stays `starting`/`unhealthy` until then. This lets other services in a Compose stack wait for stream-share to be ready before they start:

```yaml
services:
  stream-share:
    image: ghcr.io/x3n0n10/stream-share:latest
    # ... (the image already includes the HEALTHCHECK) ...

  some-dependent-service:
    depends_on:
      stream-share:
        condition: service_healthy   # waits until /healthz returns 200
```

Under the hood the check polls **`GET /healthz`**, which returns `200 {"status":"ready"}` after startup completes (the point where the server logs `Server is ready and listening` and begins accepting connections) and `503 {"status":"starting"}` before that. The endpoint is unauthenticated, trivial, and never contacts the IPTV provider, so it is cheap to poll and safe to gate ordering on.

This readiness check applies to **every** deployment and is independent of the VPN/provider feature below — that has its own separate endpoint (`/api/internal/health`) and never affects the container's health status. You can tune the check's cadence by overriding the `HEALTHCHECK` in your own Compose file (e.g. a shorter `interval` for faster ordering, or a longer `start_period` if first-time playlist fetching is slow).

---

## Provider Health Check

> **This feature is only relevant if you run stream-share behind a VPN.** Without a VPN there is no egress IP to rotate, so there is nothing for it to do — leave `HEALTHCHECK_ENABLED` off. It is separate from the container readiness check above and never affects the container's `healthy`/`unhealthy` status.

VPN egress IPs get blocked. If you run stream-share behind a VPN, the provider will periodically ban whatever server you're on and refuse live streams until you reconnect onto a fresh IP — sometimes after a few tries. This feature lets stream-share *detect* that state so an external service can reconnect the VPN automatically.

**stream-share only reports health. It never touches the VPN.** Reconnecting is deliberately left to a separate service, so this app has no dependency on any particular VPN — gluetun, WireGuard, OpenVPN, or anything else you choose. That separation is the whole design:

- **stream-share** probes one configured live channel and classifies the result — `healthy` (provider served video), `blocked` (the provider refused with a code that means "your IP is banned"), or `error` (outage, bad probe channel, transport failure). It's the right place to do this: it already holds the provider credentials and, when it shares the VPN's network namespace, its probe egresses through the exact IP a real viewer would use.
- **`GET /api/internal/health`** (authenticated) exposes that verdict as machine-readable JSON, forcing a fresh probe on each call.
- **Your watchdog** (a separate container, for whatever VPN you run) reads that endpoint and, only on `blocked`, reconnects the VPN onto a new server and re-checks in a loop. A complete example — using gluetun's control API but adaptable to any VPN — is in [`examples/vpn-watchdog/`](examples/vpn-watchdog/).

Which upstream code counts as "blocked" is configurable via `HEALTHCHECK_BLOCKED_CODES`. Many Xtream providers use **HTTP 456**, which is the default, but that code is outside the HTTP standard and providers may use others — so it is not hardcoded.

### How it works

1. On a schedule (`HEALTHCHECK_TIMES`, e.g. `04:00,16:00` in the container's `TZ`) and once at startup, stream-share dials the probe channel with the same headers a real player uses and records the verdict. It reuses the provider-error classification from the error-slate feature, so a block code is surfaced as `blocked` even though a live viewer would normally see a slate instead.
2. `GET /api/internal/health` (authenticated) **forces** a fresh probe and returns the verdict. A watchdog calls this right after reconnecting the VPN, to test whether the new IP is accepted. It's rate-limited by `HEALTHCHECK_MIN_INTERVAL_SECONDS` so it can't be used to hammer the provider. The HTTP status mirrors the verdict — `200` when healthy, `503` when blocked, errored, or stale — but a consumer should read the `status` field from the body rather than rely on the status code (a `503` here is the verdict, not a transport failure).

Probing is intentionally sparing — twice a day plus a handful of checks during an actual reconnect — because aggressive probing is exactly what gets an IP blocked faster.

The `/api/internal/health` JSON body looks like:

```json
{ "status": "blocked", "code": "456", "detail": "provider returned 456: egress IP is blocked",
  "checked_at": "2026-08-03T04:00:07Z", "age_seconds": 12, "stale": false }
```

`status` is one of `healthy`, `blocked`, `error`, `unknown` (no probe yet), or `disabled`.

### Configuration

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HEALTHCHECK_ENABLED` | `false` | Turn the provider health probe on (only useful behind a VPN) |
| `HEALTHCHECK_STREAM_ID` | — | Live channel id to probe, as it appears in a stream URL (e.g. `12345` or `12345.ts`). Pick a stable, always-on channel |
| `HEALTHCHECK_BLOCKED_CODES` | `456` | Comma-separated upstream status code(s) that mean "IP blocked" (reported as `blocked` vs generic `error`). `456` is common but non-standard, so it's configurable |
| `HEALTHCHECK_TIMES` | — | Comma-separated local `HH:MM` times to self-probe, e.g. `04:00,16:00`. Empty = probe only at startup and on demand, leaving all scheduling to the watchdog |
| `HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `15` | Per-probe timeout |
| `HEALTHCHECK_MIN_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `60` | Minimum spacing between real probes; caps how often the force-probe endpoint hits the provider |
| `HEALTHCHECK_STALE_MINUTES` | `0` | If > 0, `/api/internal/health` reports `stale` (HTTP `503`) when the last probe is older than this (catches a stalled probe loop) |

Note: this provider feature is **separate** from the container's Docker `HEALTHCHECK`, which reports readiness via `/healthz` (see [Container Health & Startup Ordering](#container-health--startup-ordering)). Enabling or disabling `HEALTHCHECK_ENABLED` never changes whether the container is reported `healthy`.

### Closing the loop (external watchdog)

See [`examples/vpn-watchdog/`](examples/vpn-watchdog/) for a ready-to-adapt script and compose snippet. It targets gluetun as a concrete example, but the pattern works for any VPN with a controllable reconnect — swap out the reconnect call. The recommended topology runs stream-share with `network_mode: "service:<vpn>"` so its provider traffic egresses through the VPN, and runs the watchdog in the same namespace so it can reach the VPN's control server on `http://localhost:8000`. The watchdog reads `/api/internal/health`, and on `blocked` reconnects the VPN onto a new server — for gluetun: stop, confirm stopped, start, confirm running (supporting both API-key and Basic-Auth control servers) — then re-runs the health check, repeating until the provider accepts the new IP or an attempt budget is exhausted. stream-share and the VPN never reference each other — the watchdog is the only piece that knows about both.

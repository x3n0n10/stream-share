# stream-share VPN watchdog (EXAMPLE)
#
# stream-share only *reports* provider health. This script is the external half
# that acts on it: on a schedule it asks stream-share whether the IPTV provider
# is blocking our current VPN egress IP, and if so it reconnects the VPN onto a
# new server and re-checks — repeating until the new IP is accepted or the
# attempt budget runs out.
#
# It lives OUTSIDE stream-share on purpose, so that app has no dependency on any
# VPN. Everything VPN-specific is here. This example targets the gluetun control
# server, but gluetun is just one option — swap cycle_vpn()/provider-independent
# bits for whatever VPN you run.
#
# The gluetun control sequence here mirrors the stream-share-dashboard reconnect
# logic: stop, confirm stopped, confirm traffic actually stopped routing, start,
# confirm running, then poll until a usable public IP comes back (gluetun can
# report "running" before it has re-resolved its IP).
#
# Requirements: a POSIX shell and `curl` (both in the alpine/curl image used by
# docker-compose.snippet.yml). It must be able to reach the stream-share internal
# API (STREAM_SHARE_URL) and the VPN control server (GLUETUN_URL).
#
# NOTE: this file must use LF line endings. CRLF (Windows) endings make a POSIX
# shell fail with errors like `: not found` on blank lines and `elif unexpected`.
# The repo enforces LF via .gitattributes; if you edited it on Windows, run
# `sed -i 's/\r$//' watchdog.sh` (or `dos2unix watchdog.sh`).
